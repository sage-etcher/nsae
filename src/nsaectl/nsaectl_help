Usage: nsaectl [-f fifo] [-htvV] (breakpoint <pc_address> | continue | exit |
           fd_eject <fd_num> | fd_load <fd_num> <file> | 
	   fd_save <fd_num> <file> | hd_eject | hd_load <file> | 
	   hd_save <file> | pause | restart | run |  status | step)

options:
  -f fifo  specify an alternate fifo for sending data to the server.
  -F fifo  specify an alternate fifo for recieving data from the server.
  -t       log only essential information (the default)
  -v       log more information
  -V       show version page
  -h       show this page

modes:
  breakpoint <pc_address>   set a breakpoint at pc_address if that value is
                              found inside the program counter pause the
                              emulator.
  continue                  continue executation after a breakpoint/pause.
  exit                      close out of the emulator.
  fd_eject <fd_num>         remove floppy from fd_num specified drive.
  fd_load <fd_num> <file>   load floppy from file into drive fd_num.
  fd_save <fd_num> <file>   save floppy into file from drive fd_num.
  hd_eject                  remove system hard disk.
  hd_load <file>            load hard disk from file into system hard disk.
  hd_save <file>            save hard disk into file from system hard disk.
  pause                     halt execution.
  restart                   restart the emulator, reinitialize the system.
  run                       start executing code from the current PC.
  status                    view information about the emulator's state.
  step                      single step the emulator 1 instruction.

fifo is the path to a named pipe to which nsaectrl can talk with nsae
over.

pc_address is a 16bit address at which if loaded into the program-counter,
will halt the emulator for debugging purposes.

fd_num is an integer index in the range of 0-1 for selecting which floppy disk
drive to interact with.

file is a path to a floppy/hard disk image to be loaded/saved into.
