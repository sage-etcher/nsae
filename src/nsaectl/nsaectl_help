fifo is the path to a named pipe to which nsaectrl can talk with nsae
over.

pc_address is a 16bit address at which if loaded into the program-counter,
will halt the emulator for debugging purposes.

fd_num is an integer index in the range of 0-1 for selecting which floppy disk
drive to interact with.

file is a path to a floppy/hard disk image to be loaded/saved into.

level is a value from 0-6 where 0 is the most verbose and 6 is silent. minimum 
log levels include all level > that selected, the levels are as follows:
0 debug, 1 verbose, 2 info, 3 warnings, 4 errors, 5 fatal errors, >5 silent
