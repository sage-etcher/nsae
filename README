# NorthStar Advantage Emulator

following <https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/OpenGL/index.php> atm, this repo 
will be renamed in the future to respect that it is for learning and not for 
the actual developement of nsae.

The repository was not renamed, and instead became the base for NSAE as was 
origonally planned.
